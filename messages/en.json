Servanda benefits from Jonas's solid leadership skills, investor network, and his drive to create new and better solutions.",
    "purposeOverview": "Servanda works to democratize the law by making it more accessible, efficient, and understandable. Accessibility has long been limited due to expensive lawyers, making the law economically inaccessible for many, with prices ranging from 800 to 6000 NOK per hour for legal assistance (DN, 2024). Even if you can afford legal services, the process takes at least a few weeks, and it is often even slower in government agencies. For example, the estimated processing time for free legal aid in Oslo and Viken is 7–9 weeks (Statsforvalteren i Oslo og Viken, n.d.). A common consumer saves both time and money by diving into legal literature to find their own answers, but this is rarely done in an afternoon without challenges. Norwegian laws and regulations are written in various language forms such as Bokmål, Nynorsk, and Old Norwegian without overlap. Additionally, Norwegian law contains many legally specific terms that ordinary consumers are not familiar with. To increase accessibility, we will create a legal model that everyone can access via a mobile application or on our website, ensuring that everyone with internet access can use our model. To minimize the processing time of legal issues, we use an optimized model that can provide quick answers to complex questions, reducing the processing time for standard legal disputes by at least 100 times. To make the law more understandable, our model converts heavy technical terms into simpler language that makes more sense to consumers. If the model uses difficult technical terms, they are also explained continuously.",
    "valuesOverview": "Servanda is committed to achieving the lowest possible emissions for the operation and training of our models. Therefore, we use renewable Norwegian energy through Norwegian data centers. The safety of our users is central to our process. To ensure this, we guarantee that your data on our platforms is protected and not shared with third parties. This gives you full control over your exposure without risk. You also have the option to delete your data, such as chat history, if you wish. We will also take steps to comply with the EU's AI regulation, as well as implement methods such as red teaming, constant monitoring of the model's performance, and possibly a kill switch.",

    "blogPostNr1Title": "The beginning",
    "blogPostNr1": "Servanda started as a modest conversation at a kiosk in Sofienbergsparken on an early autumn evening. Andreas and Bror sat together and stared out of a dirty window at Narvesen while enjoying a panini. Bror discussed legal challenges and slow processes. Andreas listened drowsily and thought to himself that legal problems should be solvable with AI, like everything else. After Bror's tenth monologue, Andreas interrupted and asked the question he had been thinking about for the last half hour: 'What if we just train a language model on the entire legal code?' Bror paused and looked skeptical. After a few minutes, he dismissed the idea as unrealistic. The idea was not mentioned again for six months. The following spring, Bror invited Andreas for pizza. He had an idea. 'What if we made that model – would it be good? If we can, what can we achieve then?' A simple question started Servanda's journey towards revolutionizing the legal process in society.",
    "blogPostNr2Title": "Not a regular startup",
    "blogPostNr2": "Servanda is not a typical startup. Our goal is to improve as much of today's legal system as possible over the next three years. We are here to learn, especially from our customers. Together, we can create the best possible product, and therefore it is important that you give us feedback if you think we can do something better. We hope you are as excited to join us on our journey, no matter where it takes us, as we are. If you know someone who could use a legal model – aka a chatbot for law – they can get free access 24/7 as long as they tell us what can be improved. We will post more about this as we approach the beta launch. You'll hear from us again soon ;) Regards, the Servanda team."

    "lovbokaOverview": "Lovboka is a legal AI assistant that provides precise answers with references to current legislation, court decisions, and legislative preparatory works. It uses RAG technology (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and updated machine learning to deliver fast and legally accurate answers. The assistant simplifies legal information without sacrificing accuracy. Both lawyers and individuals receive clear answers without having to interpret complex language. We use consolidated legislation in the Norwegian class, which ensures updated references and correct legal understanding. Lovboka not only retrieves legal texts but also subsequent changes, clarifications, and relevant legal sources. By integrating case law and legislative preparatory works, Lovboka provides a comprehensive assessment of current law. Users receive updated, anchored reflections based on actual practice and dominant interpretations.",
